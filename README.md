  ## Features

  - Easy authentication with the BlueSky API.
  - Functions to post text and images to BlueSky via the API.

  ## Installation

  ```bash
  pip install bsky-bridge
  ```

  ## Usage

  ### Creating a Session

  Start by establishing a session with your BlueSky handle and **App passwords** *(To be created in your account settings)*:

  ```python
  from bsky_bridge import BskySession

  session = BskySession("your_handle.bsky.social", "your_APPpassword")
  ```

  ### Posting Content

  After initializing a session, you can post text to BlueSky:

  ```python
  from bsky_bridge import post_text

  response = post_text(session, "Hello BlueSky!")
  print(response)
  ```

  ### Posting Images

  To post images along with text, you can use the `post_image` method:

  ```python
  from bsky_bridge import post_image

  postText = "Check out this cool image!"
  imagePath = "path_to_your_image.jpeg"
  altText = "An awesome image"
  response = post_image(session, postText, imagePath, altText)
  print(response)
  ```

  **Note**: The library automatically handles resizing and compressing larger images to ensure they do not exceed 1 MB in size, all while maintaining a quality balance. This ensures efficient and quick image uploads.
